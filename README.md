# MBZIRC Maritime Grand Challenge Simulator

This repository contains simulation software created for the
MBZIRC Maritime Grand Challenge.

## Installation

### Prerequsite

* Platform: Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
* Ignition Fortress
* ROS2 Galactic

See Installation instructions for:

* Ignition Fortress: https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/fortress

* ROS2 Galactic:  https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Binary.html


### Installation from Source

1. Create a colcon workspace and clone the mbzirc repo

    ```
    mkdir -p ~/mbzirc_ws/src
    cd ~/mbzirc_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/osrf/mbzirc.git
    ```

1. Clone the `ros_ign` repo and check out the `ros2` branch

    ```
    cd ~/mbzirc_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ros_ign.git -b ros2
    ```

1. Install dependencies using [rosdep](https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Binary.html#installing-and-initializing-rosdep)

    ```
    cd ~/mbzirc_ws
    rosdep update
    rosdep install -r --from-paths src -i -y --rosdistro galactic
    ```

    Make sure the `ros-galactic-mavros-msgs` package is installed. If not:

    ```
    sudo apt install ros-galactic-mavros-msgs
    ```

1. Build the workspace

    ```
    cd ~/mbzirc_ws
    colcon build --merge-install
    ```

### Docker setup

Docker images are available on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/osrf/mbzirc

1. Pull the latest version of the docker image

    ```
    docker pull osrf/mbzirc:mbzirc_sim_latest
    ```

1. Clone the repo and launch a Docker container from the image using the `run.bash` script. Note: requires `nvidia-docker2`

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/osrf/mbzirc.git
    cd mbzirc/docker
    bash run.bash osrf/mbzirc:mbzirc_sim_latest  /bin/bash
    ```

To build a docker image of the simulator locally:


1. Navigate to the `docker` directory and build the `mbzirc_sim` Docker image

    ```
    cd mbzirc
    bash docker/build.bash mbzirc_sim
    ```

1.  The process can take a few minutes. Once it is done, you can launch the
 Docker container:

    ```
    bash run.bash mbzirc_sim
    ```
